# YZStripeWebViewController

A simple stripe payment view controller which supports Alipay.

An web-view-based solution for supporting Chinese customers with Stripe. Native Stripe form control doesn't support Alipay as one of the avaliable payment methods, in order to address this problem, we use the web view edition of Stripe. This project demonstrate a typical use case of integrating Stripe.  

**This project may eventually developed into a Pod if more feature request is asked.**
